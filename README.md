# Coffee-Quiz
✨ Built with Claude Code This is an experiment where I'm exploring Claude Code as a Product Manager - hosting this entire quiz with just prompting and literally 5 concise prompts. No manual coding required! 🚀

## TL;DR 🚀
A playful personality quiz built **entirely using Claude Code** — no manual coding — to explore how far a **Product Manager can ship real products using prompt-driven development**.  
5 concise prompts. Fully working app. Big learnings.

## ✨ Built with Claude Code (Product Management Experiment)

This project is a **hands-on experiment in Product Management + AI-assisted development**.

Instead of writing code manually, I used **Claude Code** to:
- Design the product
- Define requirements
- Generate UI + logic
- Iterate on behavior and UX  
—all through **structured prompting**.

The entire quiz was created using **just ~5 concise prompts**.

No hand-written components.  
No local debugging marathons.  
Just product thinking → prompts → shipped output 🚀

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a Product Manager, I wanted to explore:

- How far can **prompt-driven development** go?
- Can a PM ship a **real, usable product** without touching code?
- What changes when the PM becomes the *primary interface* to engineering via AI?

This project is my answer.

## 👀 How to See / Evaluate This Project

When reviewing this project, look at it from **three lenses**:

### 1️⃣ Product Thinking
- Clear problem: *“People love personality quizzes + coffee culture”*
- Tight scope: 5 questions, 4 personalities, 1 result
- Strong constraint: **single recommendation only**
- Opinionated UX decisions (no tie-breakers, no noise)

This mirrors real-world PM tradeoffs: clarity > completeness.

---

### 2️⃣ Prompt-to-Product Workflow

This project was built by:
- Defining requirements clearly (personality mapping, UI style, logic)
- Translating PRD-style thinking into prompts
- Iterating via feedback loops instead of refactoring code

Think of Claude Code as:
> A junior-to-mid engineer that executes *exactly what your prompt quality allows*

Garbage prompt → garbage output  
Clear PM thinking → shippable product

---

### 3️⃣ Output Quality (Without Manual Code)

Despite zero manual coding:
- UI is structured and consistent
- Logic is deterministic and explainable
- Visual hierarchy is intentional
- The app is deployable and extensible

This validates that **PMs who think clearly can now build directly**.

## 📚 Key Learnings

### 🔑 1. Prompting = Product Skill
Prompting isn’t a gimmick — it’s:
- Requirement writing
- Edge-case thinking
- UX decision-making
- Scope control

Basically: **PM fundamentals in disguise**.

---

### 🔑 2. Constraints Matter More Than Code
The biggest wins came from:
- Limiting to one result
- Avoiding feature creep
- Saying no to images initially
- Defining tone and visual style upfront

Claude executed well *because* the constraints were tight.

---

### 🔑 3. PMs Can Now Prototype End-to-End
This workflow unlocks:
- Faster MVPs
- Solo experimentation
- Better collaboration with engineers
- Stronger product intuition

You don’t replace engineers —  
you **meet them halfway with working artifacts**.
